ArrayArrayLinearÅAn array data structure consists of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.Linked listListLinearˇA linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.ListListLinearçA list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a dinite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-Linear≈A self-balancing tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of level below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearÈA two-dimensional array can be visualised as a grid (or table) with rows and columns. Positions in a two dimensional array are referenced like a map using horizontal and vertical reference numbers. They are sometimes called matrices.
